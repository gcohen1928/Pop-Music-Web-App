How to Run Program: 
 
- Have all the files in the same directory (should be done already, just making sure)
- Start backend server by calling node server.js in the terminal 
- In chrome (or any web-browser except internet explorer), open test.html
- The game should be fully operating at this point

** IMPORTANT NOTE: 

- I occasionally run into an error where the Ready to Play button does not enable. This is because the request to server.js is pending.

        If this happens. keep reloading the page until it works.
        In my experience, it is dependent on how strong my internet connection is.
        If I have slow internet, it takes much longer to load then it normally would.
        Other times, it just fails due to unknown network error. 

- If this issue persists and server.js never resolves its promise, please contact me directly at gabriel.h.cohen@vanderbilt.edu
